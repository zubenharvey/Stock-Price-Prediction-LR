# Predicting Stock Prices using Linear Regression

Overview:
This project demonstrates how a linear regression model can be used to predict the stock prices of Infosys and HDFC. The aim is to analyze historical stock data, preprocess it, and train a machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

Project Description:
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the financial market. This project focuses on

1. Data Collection: Using historical stock price data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and creating features for training.
3. Model Implementation: Applying linear regression to predict stock prices.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Technologies Used:
1. Programming Language- Python 
2. Libraries- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains historical stock prices for Infosys and HDFC and includes columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close and Volume.

Usage:
1. Download the stock price data for Infosys and HDFC if not already included.
2. Update the dataset path in the code if necessary.
3. Run the script to train the model and visualize the predictions.
4. Review the output graphs and metrics to evaluate performance.
